# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Below is a guideline to help you get started with writing Java code in Visual Studio Code.

### Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

The compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

### Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## Purpose of this Repository

This repository serves as a source file for various data structures and algorithms implemented in Java. It is intended for practice and learning purposes. Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own projects or to deepen your understanding of Java programming, data structures, and algorithms.

## Table of Contents

- [LinkedList Implementation](src/LinkedList.java)
  - Simple implementation of a singly linked list with various operations.

- [Binary Search Tree Implementation](src/BinarySearchTree.java)
  - Implementation of a Binary Search Tree with various operations.

## Contribution

If you have suggestions for improvements, bug reports, or would like to contribute additional implementations, feel free
